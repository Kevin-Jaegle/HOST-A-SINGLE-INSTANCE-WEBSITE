# Host-a-single-Instance-Website

In this project I will first deploy the VPC using CloudFormation template, then create an database on Amazon RDS, also launch an EC2 instance. After that, we will set up the connection between RDS and EC2, then install the WordPress website on the instance. Finally, we will start hosting a simple WordPress website on EC2 instance and export the static assets into S3 bucket.
